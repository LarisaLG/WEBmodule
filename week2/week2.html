        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <p>This week we continue work with the objects.
        Objects group together variables and functions to create a model.
        An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This lection describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.
