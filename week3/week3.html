        <h1>Week 3</h1>
        <p>This week we do some revision about Javascript basics such making decision, Loops and using functions. Also this week we looked at the objects.
        <p>This week we continue work with the objects.
       This lection covered how to create several objects to represent similar things.
You create instances of the object using the constructor function. The <b>new</b> keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object.
The <b>this</b> keyword is used instead of the object name to indicate that the property or method belongs to the object that this function creates.</p>
<p>During this week  was covered topic about Functions, making decision and Loops. </p>
<p>Also was covered topic about Bugs, bug detection and testing software. </p>
