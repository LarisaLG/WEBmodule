        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <p>This week we looked at the module content.</p>
        <p>Just went through breifly what topics would be covered this semester.</p>
        <p>This lab, as it is the first lab of the second semester, is intended as an exercise to refresh the students memory on some HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>
		<p>Also in this lab you will create an array and display an element of that array on a web page</p>
		<p>A lab was posted on moodle along with the solution and we were advised to complete the lab in our own time.</p>
